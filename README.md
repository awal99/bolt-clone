### Pushing your generated code to git

The system comes with a custom jsh which allows for executing some shells commands and scripts specifically in node and webAssemble. Most of the unix shell commands would not work as the base service (webcontainer) runs the jsh in a node environment and do not run directly on unix.

use the isomorphic-git cli to complete your git tasks

[Isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/docs/en/alphabetic)

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
